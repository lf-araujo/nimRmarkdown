# Nimrmarkdown

This is a collection of R functions that extends knitr's capability 
for using Nim as a language engine.  They have no use if you do not 
also have Nim installed.

You can install these as an R package:
```
devtools::install_github("lf_araujo/nimrmarkdown")
```
Then you can check with
```
library(nimrmarkdown)
help(package="nimrmarkdown")
```
If the package was installed, you should see an R Help page..

This is beta software and this project was a clone of https://github.com/Hemken/Statamarkdown and needs testing. Locally, at this moment, this package works as expected. Only Linux is supported, but PRs are welcome.


If you would like to contribute to this project, please "fork" it on Github and then clone it back to your working environment.  Make your changes and enhancements, push them back to your Github repository, then initiate a "pull" request.
